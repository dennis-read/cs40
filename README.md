# HW1 - Fractions

Sample implemenation, built up incrementally through milestones.  These are the themes. 

* M0 - Scaffold
* M1 - Constructor
* M2 - operator =
* M3 - operator <<
* M4 - operator >>
* M5 - operator +
* M6 - operator -

Work is managed in a git repository, with each milestone linked to label.  The goal to show how the solution builds up incrementally. 

# Principles

Develop good habits by adhering to best practices.

1. Apply test-driven development

        Acceptance tests use provided sample input and output.
        Unit tests are written for each individual feature.

2. Create useful abstratcions

        Fractions have interesting abstractions, for example:
            Numerator, Denominator
            Quotient, Remainder
            Proper Fraction, Whole Number, Mixed Number.
        These influence behavior, and should be first class concepts in code.

3. Use platform services, where available

        For example, applying regular expressions, instead of writing a parser.

4. Favor minimal definitions and implementations.

        Milestone M0 exposes a working public API where:
          Implementations are trivial, and known to be incorrect.
          All acceptances tests fail, but unit test pass.
        Subsequent milestones target acceptance tests for passage.
